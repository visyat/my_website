<p>Welcome to my Nonograms game! Or at least what will become my Nonograms game LOL.</p>
<p>This is a bit humiliating, since its absolute basic front-end programming. The fundamentals of HTML that they teach you in any coding bootcamp. </p>
<p>Whatever, the actual hard/interesting bit is figuring out how to store and call data and machine learning models on these platforms. Front-end is just the UI; doesn't need to look extremely nice. Back-end is what is going to accept data, call the model stored elsewhere, & produce the output. The only reason I'm learning this is so that I can launch and actually utilize a rudimentary UI for my projects. </p>
<p>Anyways, I now have a homepage on a personal server that I can customize using HTML script. So far, I know how to add basic lines of text, and a heading. </p>
