# Very First Django Project

Version 2 now displays a rudimentary website that displays a heading and a few paragraphs/sentences of text. All features are customizable using the HTML template imposed on the 'home' URL views.py. urls.py refers all URL calls to the base app, instead of processing them immediately within the larger project file. This file structuring is done for the sake of legibility and quality; the logic behind individual apps can become very complex, so best to do URL handling for each project in that app's separate directory.
