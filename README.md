# Very First Django Project

Version 3 now displays a basic personal website, with personal details, contact information, hyperlinked text to relevant accomplishments/projects, etc. Used HTML to write the home page template to which the view URL was linked. Additionally, for more complex multi-page websites, can have templates inherited from each other to have the same format, navbar, etc. Can also divide app-specific templates into individual template folders for each app.

Stored here for posterity, or in case I want to restore it for further modification. Currently, not of high enough quality to publish as a project (demonstrates nothing but an elementary grasp of front-end programming); also need to get on with my actual designated project. 

**Note: HTML is very intuitive, and designing basic text websites (of the kind of 40 years ago & the UCLA Computer Science Department LOL) is extremely straightforward.**
